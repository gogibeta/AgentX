# Privacy & Security

AgentX is a BYOK client. It does not operate a relay for chat completions: requests go from your device to the provider, model server, or tool endpoint you configure.

## Data stored on the device

Conversations, message trees, tasks, loops, memories, prompts, attachments, and tool media are stored in AgentX-managed databases/files. Ordinary settings use Android preferences. Secret settings normally use an AES-256-GCM envelope backed by the Android Keystore; legacy plaintext remains readable and encryption failure deliberately stores plaintext rather than losing the value.

Deleting app data or uninstalling the app removes app-managed data unless Android backup or an exported archive preserves it.

## When data leaves the device

Only features you use create their corresponding traffic:

- chat, title, transcription, image, and embedding requests go to their selected model/provider
- web queries go to the selected search provider
- MCP calls go to enabled MCP servers
- Conch or SSH operations go to configured devices
- update checks retrieve release metadata at app startup, at most once per day
- the optional rating form sends only the rating, name, email, and comment you submit to `https://newoether.com/api/rating`
- after a crash, one report is stored locally; on next launch you may explicitly send its stack trace, app/Android version, device manufacturer/model, timestamp, and bounded diagnostic tags to `https://newoether.com/crash`

Crash reports are never uploaded automatically and do not contain conversation text, credentials, or device identifiers. AgentX has no general analytics/telemetry path.

## Backups and secrets

A `.agentx` export is a ZIP archive. If you explicitly include API keys/secrets, those values are unencrypted inside the archive. Keep that file private and delete copies you no longer need.

## Proxy and transport

The configured network proxy covers shared HTTP-client traffic, not direct SSH, on-device inference, or sandbox process networking. TLS and endpoint trust still matter. Conch application-layer encryption requires an API key; blank-key Conch uses plain JSON and relies on HTTPS for transport confidentiality.

Review the endpoint URLs, server certificates, provider terms, and tool permissions before sending sensitive content.
